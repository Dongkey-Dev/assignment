# Session 3: Event Server Implementation and Containerization

## Overview
In this session, we focused on implementing the Event Server, refactoring the codebase to use path aliases, and setting up containerization for the microservices architecture. We addressed import path issues, ensured proper integration of the condition checker service, and configured Docker for each service.

## Key Changes

### 1. Path Alias Configuration
- Updated `tsconfig.json` to include path aliases for `@event`, `@gateway`, `@auth`, `@libs`, and `@constants`
- Configured Jest to recognize these path aliases in the `package.json`
- Refactored import statements across the codebase to use the new path aliases

### 2. Event Server Implementation
- Created the Event Server structure with controllers, services, and modules
- Refactored the condition checker service to `RewardsConditionCheckerService` for better naming
- Implemented proper integration between the Event Server and other components
- Added necessary configurations in `nest-cli.json` to support the Event Server

### 3. TypedQuery Fix
- Created a `RewardHistoryQueryDto` interface for query parameters
- Updated the `getRewardHistory` method in `rewards.controller.ts` to use the new DTO
- Fixed test files to match the updated controller method signature

### 4. Docker Configuration
- Created Dockerfiles for each service (auth, gateway, event):
  - Used multi-stage builds to optimize image size
  - Configured proper environment variables and ports
  - Set up appropriate build and runtime commands
- Created a specialized Dockerfile for Swagger documentation
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include all services with proper configuration

### 5. Swagger Documentation
- Updated the Nestia configuration to generate Swagger documentation for the Gateway service
- Created a dedicated service for serving Swagger documentation
- Configured the Swagger UI to be accessible through a separate port

## Technical Details

### Path Aliases
Added the following path aliases to simplify imports:
```json
{
  "@auth": ["apps/auth"],
  "@event": ["apps/event"],
  "@gateway": ["apps/gateway"],
  "@libs": ["libs"],
  "@constants": ["libs/common/constants"]
}
```

### Docker Services
Configured the following services in docker-compose.yml:
- **mongodb**: Database service
- **auth**: Authentication service (port 3001)
- **gateway**: API Gateway service (port 3002)
- **gateway-swagger**: Swagger documentation service (port 8080)
- **event**: Event processing service (port 3003)

### RewardsConditionCheckerService
Refactored the condition checker service to:
- Use proper path aliases
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Integrate correctly with the Event Server

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**:
   - Ensure all tests pass with the new structure
   - Add more comprehensive tests for the Event Server

2. **Deployment**:
   - Test the Docker setup in a development environment
   - Prepare for production deployment

3. **Documentation**:
   - Enhance API documentation
   - Document the microservices architecture

4. **Feature Development**:
   - Implement additional event types
   - Enhance reward processing capabilities
